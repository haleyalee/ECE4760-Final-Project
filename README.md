## PIC32 Racing Video Game

This project is a racing game with human input control that emulates the act of driving a car. The goal of the game is to cross the finish line in the shortest amount of time while avoiding obstacle collisions, which result in an added time penalty. The player uses an acceleration pedal, a brake pedal, and a steering wheel to control the movement of the car across the CRT display.

The goal of this project was to make the controls of our game as similar to the experience of driving a real car. Thus, the functionality of the hardware parts should mimic the functionality of a vehicle. This was achieved by constructing two pedals from wood and 3D printing a steering wheel. Whereas the sensitivity of the pedals was adjusted based on ADC readings of the slide-potentiometers, the wheelâ€™s steering was determined by an accelerometer, which required an Arduino driver.
